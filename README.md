# My_Projects
The code of my previous projects


1) BML Generate
   This is a project in AICV LAB of Boston University, aiming to train a GAN to generate MRI images of Knees including healthy ones and BML ones. The models include AC-GAN and DC-GAN.

2) Cover_Plate_Detection
   This is a project to detect the anomalous part or flaws during producing, and check the quelity of production with these information. The model YOLOv5 is used to do the detection job while ResNet works as a classifier, and plenty of conventional image processing techniques are used.

3) E-Cigarette_Smoke_Pipes_Detection
   This a project to detect the categories of flaws when producing e-cigarette smoke pipes, working as an auxiliary tool for quality inspection. It is a multi-model combining Computer Vision techniques and time series analysis, because the camera cannot catch the information inside the product. To deal with is problem, we collect other forms of data.
