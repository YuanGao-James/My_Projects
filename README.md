# My_Projects
The code of my previous projects


1) BML Generate
   This is a project in AICV LAB of Boston University, aiming to train a GAN to generate MRI images of Knees including healthy ones and BML ones. The models include AC-GAN and DC-GAN.

2) Cover_Plate_Detection
   This is a project to detect the anomalous part or flaws during producing, and check the quelity of production with these information. The model YOLOv5 is used to do the detection job while ResNet works as a classifier, and plenty of conventional image processing techniques are used.

3) E-Cigarette_Smoke_Pipes_Detection
   This a project to detect the categories of flaws when producing e-cigarette smoke pipes, working as an auxiliary tool for quality inspection. It is a multi-model combining Computer Vision techniques and time series analysis, because the camera cannot catch the information inside the product. To deal with is problem, we collect other forms of data.

4) Flask
   This is a project to establish a full stack, to do a real-time anomaly detection of factory production. The cameras capture the images of pruduct and upload them on the website, while the back end computers check them with neural networks and inform the workers.

5) GANomaly
   This is a project to design a GAN to do the anomaly detection. We tried our own data on the famous model GANomaly.

6) Hand_Seg
   This is a project in AICV LAB of BU. The dataset is a bunch of X-Ray images of hands, our goal is to detect the position of hand joints, segment the bones, measure the inclination angle of joints, and estimate the joint space width which is strongly realated to hand osteoarthritis.

7) Path_Signature
   This is a project to make predictions from stack data, which is in the form of time series. We create a neural network model for the data, adding a transformation to map the data into a feature space, and figure out the relationship through it.

8) PolyimideFilm Classification
   This is a anomaly detection project, to specify the flaws on the polyimide film.
